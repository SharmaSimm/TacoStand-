Taco Stand Inventory
The Taco Stand Inventory is a Python program that simulates the inventory management system of a taco stand. It allows users to interact with the program as if they were running the stand, performing actions like:

Adding Funds: Users can enter an amount of money to increase the available funds for purchasing taco supplies.
Ordering Supplies: Users can allocate a budget to buy more tacos. The program checks if there are sufficient funds and updates the inventory with the newly purchased tacos (assuming enough budget is available).

Opening the Stand: Once funds are added, users can open the stand virtually. This displays the current inventory levels and a menu with taco options and prices.

Taking Orders: Users can choose a type of taco and the number of tacos they want to order. The program checks if there are enough tacos in stock and, if so, updates the inventory and calculates the total cost based on the chosen tacos and quantity.

Exiting the Stand: Users can choose to exit the program, ending their virtual interaction with the taco stand.
Benefits:

This program serves as an educational tool to practice:

Conditional statements (if-else): 
The program extensively uses conditional statements to control the flow based on user actions (choice of action, availability of funds/tacos, etc.). This allows users to understand how conditional statements make decisions within a program.

Inventory Management:
The program simulates real-world inventory management scenarios, such as keeping track of stock levels, updating inventory after purchases, and checking availability before fulfilling orders.
Overall, the Taco Stand Inventory program provides a fun and interactive way to learn about conditional statements and inventory management principles in Python.
